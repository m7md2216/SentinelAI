## üåü Inspiration
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet they often lack the resources to protect themselves from cyber threats. Statistics show that **95% of SMB breaches result in damages ranging from $800 to $650,000**, and most small businesses shut down within **six months of a cyberattack**. 

With high costs of cybersecurity teams and complex compliance regulations like **GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2**, we saw an opportunity to leverage AI to **bridge this gap**‚Äîmaking cybersecurity accessible, automated, and effective.
